# FPGA-PONG-GAME
A classic Pong game implemented on FPGA using VHDL, featuring real-time 640√ó480 VGA output at 60Hz, button-controlled input, and a finite state machine for game logic and scoring



üìÅ Project Modules Overview
1. Seven Segment Display Interface
Displays each player's score using two seven-segment displays. Player 1‚Äôs score is shown on the first display and Player 2‚Äôs on the second. The game resets automatically when either player reaches a score of 9.

2. UART Receiver Controller
Implements a UART receiver that listens for input from a keyboard. The game remains idle until a valid UART signal is received, which then triggers the game to start.

3. VGA Controller
Generates a 640√ó480 VGA video signal at 60Hz. Handles horizontal and vertical synchronization, pixel timing, and screen refresh to render the game objects in real-time on a VGA display.

4. Ball Control
Handles the logic for ball movement, screen boundary collision, paddle interaction, and drawing the ball on the screen.

5. Paddle Control
Manages paddle movement based on user input, collision detection with the ball, and rendering the paddles on the display.

6. Game Logic (FSM)
Implements the core game mechanics using a finite state machine (FSM). Tracks the game state, updates scores, detects winning conditions based on ball-paddle interactions, and controls game flow.

7. Top Module
Serves as the main integration unit, instantiating and connecting all submodules. Designed for modularity and ease of modifying game settings or expanding functionality.
